Citizen is a beautiful, usable, responsive <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a> skin that makes <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extensions">extensions</a> part of the cohesive experience. Originally made for the Star Citizen Wiki, it has now been made flexible to run on various MediaWiki configurations.

Unlike the other standard MediaWiki skins, Citizen has a lot more to offer:
