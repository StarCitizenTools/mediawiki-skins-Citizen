## Indirect contributors
* **[Jon Robson](https://github.com/jdlrobson)** for advocating and working in the MediaWiki skin ecosystem. It makes skin development much more accessible and makes many of *Citizen's* features possible.
* **Wiki admins** who deploy *Citizen* on their wikis. It helps us test *Citizen* in different use cases, making it more versatile for the community.
* **[Wikimedia Foundation Core Experiences teams](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Core_Experiences)** for their extensive design research. It drives many of the design decisions in *Citizen* that would otherwise be unable to validate quantitatively.
* **Various WMF Design Systems teams** for their effort to build, maintain, and implement design systems (MWUI, OOUI, Codex) across the MediaWiki ecosystem. It significantly reduces the work needed for *Citizen* to provide a cohesive design.
* **Other WMF-deployed skins such as [Vector](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Vector), [MinervaNeue](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Minerva_Neue), and [Timeless](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Timeless)** for some of the features and best practices in a MediaWiki skin. They became a part of the foundation of what *Citizen* has become today.
